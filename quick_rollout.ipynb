The second and third beliefs both have '2' in the second position, so we can rule out '2' in the second position in the first belief. We can also rule out '3' in the second position in the second belief, as '0' is consistently in the first position. So, we can eliminate those options and focus on the remaining characters. The third belief has '1' in the second position, so we can eliminate '1' from the second position in the first belief. The second belief has '3' in the third position, so we can eliminate '3' from the third position in the first belief. We have narrowed down the possibilities for the second and third positions in the first belief to '1', '2', '4', '5', '6', '7', and '8'. We can try querying with '1', '2', '4', '5', '6', '7', and '8' in the second and third positions in the first belief, and see if we can eliminate any more options.</think><action>['1', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']</action>\", tool_calls=None), Message(role='user', content='6 is not in the lock\\n7 is in Position 2!\\n8 is in Position 3!', tool_calls=None)]},\n",
